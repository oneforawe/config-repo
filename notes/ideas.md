## more immediate

To search for `TODO` items in the code, execute the following at the root
directory `~/.config-files`:

`grep -r 'TODO' .`

Consider: package-managers (homebrew, conda, pip, apt); packages (including
environment managers, etc); automating more settings and configurations (some
usually done by GUI); recovery; further automation of backup procedures.

Also consider: Integration of action management system(s); email management and
archiving; secure and redundant systems/backups.
