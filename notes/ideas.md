## more immediate

To search for `TODO` items in the code, execute the following at the root
directory `~/.config-repo`:

`grep -r 'TODO' .`

Consider: automating setup and maintenance of package-managers (homebrew, conda,
pip, apt); packages (including environment managers, etc); automating more
settings and configurations (some usually done by GUI); recovery; further
automation of backup procedures.

Also consider: Integration of action management system(s); email management and
archiving; secure and redundant systems/backups.
