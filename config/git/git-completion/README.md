# git-completion

Files saved from the
[git-completion](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/)
contribution folder in the [git repo](https://github.com/git/git).

See these files (eg, `git-completion.bash` for instructions on setup and
activation.)

Since this is a sub-section of a large package and I don't want to save the
whole repo here, only the necessary files have been copied and saved here.
Perhaps there's a better way to do this (eg, to refer to files that are
already present in an installation of git(?)), but this works for now.
