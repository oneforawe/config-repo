## git-completion

`git-completion` is working; use the tab key to see options. See its files (eg,
`git-completion.bash` for instructions on setup and activation.)

## git-flow-completion

`git-flow-completion` is not working yet; using the tab key does show options.
Instead just use the word help after `git flow` to see options.
