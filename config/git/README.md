# git

## diff-so-fancy

Added `diff-so-fancy` with the following command in the `git` folder:

`git submodule add https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy diff-so-fancy`

(Had to choose a location in the PATH in the bash config files from which to
link to this package to make `diff-so-fancy` globally available.  Also created
an alias `difff` that uses `diff-so-fancy` with the usual `diff`.)


## git-completion

`git-completion` is working; use the tab key to see options.


## git-flow-completion

`git-flow-completion` is not working yet; using the tab key does show options.
Instead just use the word help after `git flow` to see options.
