If you want to use this version of the file, you could copy the
`copy_binary_com.googlecode.iterm2.plist` file as
`com.googlecode.iterm2.plist` in the parent directory for easy reference.

Might want to use one of the other files though:  
* `reference-files-3.4.8/copy_com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`
* `reference-files-3.4.9/` latest version of `com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`

Copy one of those to the parent directory as `com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.
