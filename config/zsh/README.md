# zsh

I use the z shell and oh-my-zsh.  See the general references below for some
introduction.

To get clarity on how zsh handles its config files, see the table in
reference 1.  Note that from `.zshrc` I source multiple files (including
`zshrc_omz` and `zshrc_opt`).

## reminder to self

When updating the submodule `oh-my-zsh`, after the update is pushed to master
and then pulled to another machine, it seems that I have to delete it
(`rm -r oh-my-zsh`) and then update the submodules  (`git submodule update`) to
properly checkout the updated submodule (`oh-my-zsh`).
