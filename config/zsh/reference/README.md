# Reference

For reference, a template document is kept here showing a version of a zsh
config file used to add the `conda` package and environment manager from the
Anaconda distribution to the shell PATH.

This file, once modified with the code provided by `conda init`, can be placed
in the location specified in the `zshrc` file, to be sourced.
