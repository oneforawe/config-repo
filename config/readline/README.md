# readline

GNU Readline is a general utility for command-line interaction that can be used
by many different programs, giving a consistent experience across those
different programs.  In the file `inputrc` you can select a pre-defined key
mapping (emacs style by default, or vi style) or define your own custom key
mapping with individually defined key bindings (or "hot keys" or keyboard
"short-cuts", etc).


## un-ideal

In an ideal world, all of my preferred key bindings could be defined in one
place (say, the inputrc file here) and referred-to by all the different
programs.  Maybe that's possible, but I don't know how to do it yet.  So,
instead, I'll leave some notes here about all the places where I define my key
bindings and access information about them.

* Definitions
  * `readline/inputrc`
  * `bash/bashrc_opt`
  * `zsh/zshrc_opt`
  * `vim/vimrc`
  * `emacs/emacs.el`
* Info
  * __Regarding readline__
    * Get info:  
      `$ info` (and search for readline) or  
      `$ info rluserman`
  * __Regarding bash__
    * Get info:  
      `$ man bash`  (search bind)  
      `$ help bind`
    * Get current map:  
      `$ bind -p`
  * __Regarding zsh__
    * Get info:  
      `$ man zsh`  
      `$ man zshbuiltins`  (search bind or bindkey)  
      `$ man zshzle`  (z line-editor)  
      etc
    * Get current map:  
      `$ bindkey -L`
    * Override, switch current map:  
      `$ bindkey -e`  (switch to emacs)  
      `$ bindkey -v`  (switch to vi)
  * __Regarding vim__
    * Get info:  
      `:help map`  
    * Get current map:  
      `:map`
  * __Regarding emacs__
    * Default key bindings, good reference:  
       https://caiorss.github.io/Emacs-Elisp-Programming/Keybindings.html
    * Get info:  
      `$ emacs`  (follow instructions to see help, manual, tutorial)  
      Can also see more info at:  
      `$ man emacs`  
      `$ info emacs`
    * Get current map:  
      `C-h ? b`  (to see help options and select b to see all key bindings)  
      `C-h b`  (faster)
