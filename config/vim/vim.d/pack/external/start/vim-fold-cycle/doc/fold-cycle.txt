DESCRIPTION                                          *fold-cycle-description*

This plugin provides the ability to cycle open and closed folds and their
nested folds. It could also be described as a type of visibility cycling
similar to Emacs org-mode.

USAGE                                                      *fold-cycle-usage*


<CR>                    Cycle open folds starting at the top level fold.
                        Subsequent invocations will open folds nested one
                        level under the top level fold. When all folds are
                        open, the next invocation will close the current fold
                        recursively. This mapping does override the default
                        behavior of <CR>.

                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-cycle-open)`


<BS>                    Cycle close folds starting at the lowest nested fold.
                        Subsequent invocations will close the next level of
                        nested folds. When all folds are closed the next
                        invocation will open the fold opened recursively. This
                        mapping does override the default behavior of <BS>.

                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-cycle-close)`

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                      *fold-cycle-configuration*

g:fold_cycle_default_mapping                   *g:fold_cycle_default_mapping*
                       If set to 0 disables the default mappings.
                       Defaults to 1.

                       Example of alternate mappings: >

                       let g:fold_cycle_default_mapping = 0 "disable default mappings
                       nmap <Tab><Tab> <Plug>(fold-cycle-open)
                       nmap <S-Tab><S-Tab> <Plug>(fold-cycle-close)
