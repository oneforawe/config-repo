# Setup

Eventually, I should have just a few commonly used executable files here that
set up and install my configuration files.  (Getting closer!)  Files to be
over-written should be saved in a time-stamped `~/.config-replaced` folder.

## generating packages list

Prune the file generated:

`brew leaves > packages-to-install-excessive.txt`

Do something similar in Linux.
